# House Price Project (King County Dataset)

## Introduction
My friend is an extraordinary good Freelance Data Scientist. He is currently looking for a partner to found a Data Science Company in King County, WA. Since there is a lot of money to be made there. He wants to help rich people to accomplish private goals with data. He is very smart and has already figured out which house would be perfect to start his business: It must be cheap, near his potentiell rich clients, should have a bathroom...thats about it. 
### Now he wants to test me (his potential) partner, if I can come up with recommendations.

## Questions to be asked
* What does he have to do to find a relatively cheap property near his clients?
* How can he improve his chances to find a place?
* Must he be willing to renovate it? How small can you go?
* What determines the price?
* He wants to sell a prediction model to his clients. How good is your model commpared to his perfect one?
* How good is the model for predictions? What is missing?
* How much percent of the houses have waterfront? In what zipcode do the rich live?
